# RGBD Segmentation Software
This software performs segmentation of RGBD images (an RGB image and a corresponding depth image). This software is built upon the following research work.

Note that this software is still work-in-progress. It is built upon unoptimized versions of the above algorithms without real-time performance. The default parameters are not optimal for every RGB-D image, and the output varies with respect to the parameters. If you use this software, please cite the above research.

## Requirements

This software was built and tested using Windows 7. The software has dependencies on the following libraries which are already included in the repository as dll files.

- Accord (The framework is licensed under the GNU Lesser Public License v2.1 available at: http://accord-framework.net/license.html)
- AForge (AForge.NET Framework is published under LGPL v3 license available at: http://www.aforgenet.com/framework/license.html)
- EmguCV (The framework is licensed under the GNU GPL license v3)
- OpenTK (The toolkit is distributed under the permissive MIT/X11 license)

## Operation
### Inputs
An RGB image and a depth image with 640×480 resolution.
Note that the parameters of the software are tuned with respect to the default 640×480 image size.
### Outputs
1. **Initial segmentation**: oversegmentation into structurally planar patches.
2. **Depth segmentation**: perceptual grouping of patches into object hypotheses using only depth information.
3. **Rgbd segmentation**: Segmentation using both color and depth information.
## GUI based operation

1. Run the software from RGBD_segmentation.exe
2. Load an RGB image and a registered depth image using the GUI.
3. Click **Run** to perform segmentation.

The segmentation results can be saved as PNG files by clicking the **Save results** button on the GUI. Note that the default parameters are not optimal for every RGB-D image. The values can be changed using the sliders to obtain the best segmentation. Every time the parameters are changed, click **Run** to produce the new results.

## Command line based operation
The software also allows command line operation using windows command prompt. Following are some example commands:
### Examples
1. To generate superpixels, use the sp_flag as below:

'rgbd_segmentation console sp_flag=true'

2. To turn-off output visualization, use the disp_flag as below:

rgbd_segmentation console disp_flag=false
